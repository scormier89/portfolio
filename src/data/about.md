# About Me

Iâ€™m a full-stack developer with 15+ years of experience in Angular, Vue, React, C#, Java (J2EE, Spring, JSF, Hibernate), and Azure. My expertise lies in building scalable enterprise applications, workflow visualization tools, cloud infrastructures, and automation pipelines.

Iâ€™ve worked extensively in enterprise software development, primarily in the insurance sector, designing and maintaining UI-heavy applications, backend systems, and DevOps architectures. My background includes front-end development, workflow visualization (GoJS), Kubernetes, and data transformation (XSL/XSLT, JSON, XML).

# Career Journey

- 1997-98: First exposure to computers, exploring software and basic automation.
- High School (Intro to Coding): Started writing batch scripts to automate tasks and play pranks, sparking an interest in how software controlled systems.
- High School (Programming Courses): Found programming intuitive and easy, consistently earning top grades with minimal effort.
- University & College: Initially pursued kinesiology, but quickly switched to Web App Development, driven by a desire to understand and build systems from the ground up.
- Brovada (Insurance Software & Data Transformation)  
  - Began with maintenance and bug fixes for Pembridge.  
  - Later took on a key role in a broker data transformation project, creating a custom markup language that allowed brokers to define transformation rules.  
  - Led the POC phase, then focused on the UI side, building a vanilla HTML/jQuery frontend with a Node.js backend for editing transformation files and version history management.  
  - Worked on BrovadaOne, maintaining XSL/XSLT transformations that converted broker policy data into CSIO (ACORD) formats before routing them to insurers.  
  - Acquisition: Brovada was acquired by Towers Watson (WTW), where I continued working on BrovadaOne.
- WTW (Workflow Visualization, Kubernetes & Helm)  
  - Created an NPM package for the Unify Team â€“ A custom Angular wrapper around GoJS to provide workflow visualization and editing capabilities for WTWâ€™s customers.  
  - Initially worked with a 3-person team (Canada), but took over full ownership after a few months.  
  - Designed the package to be modular and reusable, allowing other teams to leverage it across WTWâ€™s tech stack.  
  - Fully tested using Cypress (e2e tests) and Karma (unit tests).  
  - Built a mock parent app for testing, ensuring smooth integration, maintainability, and UI/UX consistency.  
  - Maintained & added REST endpoints in C#, getting hands-on backend experience.  
  - 5-year-long project, evolving through multiple iterations and feature expansions post-MVP release.  
  - Became an expert in GoJS and gained deep proficiency in Angular through this project.  
  - Cloud Automation: Tasked with simplifying BrovadaOne's deployment.  
  - Started with a Dockerized version, then expanded to a clusterized release on AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service).  
  - Discovered Helm and implemented Helm charts to automate and manage deployments more efficiently.
